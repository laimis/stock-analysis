DESIGN

- the whole Watch section is incomplete, what to do there
- market cap/gross profit, should all be rounded
- fundamentals section should be a card layout

BUGS
- share buy/sell is a disaster from UX/usability/flow standpoint
- option dates seem to be off, it should not be a single date
- int for money amounts
- review how we track partial share and option sales
- how to correct this whole "key" vs "ticker" on events..
