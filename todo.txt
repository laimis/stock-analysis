- organize code: separate events from handlers from core domain models?
- import validation (size, contents, headers)
- login tracking

DESIGN
- custom bootstrap components for dropdowns, dates

- fundamentals section should be a card layout

BUGS
- share buy/sell is a disaster from UX/usability/flow standpoint
- option dates seem to be off, it should not be a single date

- export of options, amount sometimes is zero
