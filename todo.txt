- notes, fill with share information when note is made
- organize code: separate events from handlers from core domain models?
- import validation (size, contents, headers)

DESIGN
- consider cards for rendering owned options, owned stock... might get too much?
- dropdown for option type selection
- the whole Watch section is incomplete, what to do there
- market cap/gross profit, should all be rounded
- fundamentals section should be a card layout

BUGS
- share buy/sell is a disaster from UX/usability/flow standpoint
- option dates seem to be off, it should not be a single date
- int for money amounts
- review how we track partial share and option sales
- how to correct this whole "key" vs "ticker" on events..
- export of options, amount sometimes is zero
